          Hello Fellow Pilots,
        </p>
        <p>
        This message is from the newly formed Coalition for Airlines Pilots Age 68 Retirement Poltical Action
        Committee.
        </p>
        <p>Our mission is to raise the mandatory retirement age for pilots in the U.S. to 68.</p>
        <p>
        As you may know, on December 13,2007, the “Fair Treatment for Experienced Pilots Act” was signed into
law. This raised the mandatory age for retirement from 60 to 65 - a change that was long overdue. Now, in
2021, with over 13 years of data collection, we know it was the right thing to do because it put safety first.
Experience matters! And now it’s time to do it again! Let’s keep safety first with experienced pilots in the
cockpit, and in keeping with other countries, raise the mandatory retirement age to 68!
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are currently in your airline’s PAC, ask yourself, “Are they advocating to raise the mandatory
retirement age?” We have come through tough times that prompted early retirements. Consequently,
leaving our cockpits with a lack of experience. So now the need is greater than ever to raise the mandatory
retirement age to 68!
        </p>
        <p>If you would like to join our efforts, please visit www.Cap68.com and sign up. We look forward to working
with you!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>CAP68</p>
